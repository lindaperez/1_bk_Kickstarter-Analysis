1. When is the best time to lauch the Play campaign. 

2. Is it an strategic decision to create a crowdfunding with that particular budget, should the budget be less or more? Are there any relationship between the goal and successful campaigns? 

3. Create the campaign in a different country may help funding the goal budget?

4. How long would be the campaign?

 
Part of the challeging things could be to understand the business, the requirements and how to get to the solutions without the module guidance. 



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The best way to compare how are the months balanced over the years is the pivot chart.
